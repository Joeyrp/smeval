# SMEVAL (Simple Math EVALuator)
This project is based on the simple math interpreter by David Callanan found here: https://github.com/davidcallanan/py-simple-math-interpreter

# Usage
Run the program from a command line or terminal. Type any valid math expression using +, -, *, /, % (remainder) and then press enter to evaluate the expression. Parentheses may be used to change the order of operations. To quit the progam type `quit`. Values with no decimal point are stored as integers otherwise they are floats. The remainder operation (%) only works with interget values.
